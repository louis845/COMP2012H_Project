# GUI-TODO
## Important
* Add one more display area to display the scanned OCR image
* Make it dynamic, when the above display area is not visible (setVisible(false)) the GUI won't be bugged/ugly.
* Add another list area of labels (can add or remove) to let user select previous computation results/steps
* Add loading bar/spinner for computation.


## Less important
* Create a new window UI to display user manual.
* User manual window contains a QTreeView to browse the documentations
* Contains another area to display the document

## Not important
* Add logo in the initial window of prompting API key and password
